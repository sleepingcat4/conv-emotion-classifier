# Emotional Analysis Using Audio Features

## Introduction
Emotional analysis is a fascinating task in deep learning and artificial intelligence. Traditionally, it has been performed by analyzing sentences, but this approach often fails to capture subtle details, making it less robust. Audio introduces a new paradigm by allowing us to extract features and train a simple neural network to classify emotions from unseen data files.

This notebook explores this approach, building on past work as a foundation, with plans for further modifications.

## Whatâ€™s Achieved?
- **Trainable Neural Network**: Classifies audio files based on emotions.
- **Feature Extraction**: Audio features are extracted and prepared for training.
- **Colab Integration**: Fully operational on Google Colab.

## How Can It Be Improved?
- **More Epochs**: Training for a larger number of epochs could enhance performance.
- **Data Augmentation**: Applying more augmentation techniques to enrich the dataset.
- **Balanced Data**: Ensuring each class has a balanced representation.
- **Advanced Feature Extraction**: Extracting additional and more meaningful audio features.
